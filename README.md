Inertial navigation
===================

Octave code for inertial navigation.
Adapted from CAN SAT 2.0 Italian project for the European competition. It needs data from both accelerometer and gyroscope to function.

Aside from the core computational modules, you can find various macros for charting different quantities.

Feel free to use and fork the code. Happy hacking.
