# **Inertial navigation**

Octave code for an inertial navigation system. Adapted from [CAN SAT 2.0](http://www.cansat.eu/cansat-competitions) Italian project for the European competition.

The main purpose is to find the path travelled by the device from which the data (from both accelerometer and gyroscope) is gathered.

Aside from the core computational modules, you can find various macros for charting different quantities with `gnuplot`.

Feel free to use and fork the code. *Happy hacking*.
